            <h3>  PROJECT - Website for  the Redeemer's University Association of Computer Science Students.<br>The RUNACOSS website. </h3>
            <p>The RUNACOSS website  was developed using a thorough strategy that included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
                HTML provides the structural underpinning by defining the layout and structure of the material. This covers the basic features of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, buttons and forms.
                CSS was critical in improving the visual attractiveness of the page. CSS was used to make the design consistent and attractive by adding styles to the fonts, colors, backgrounds, and layout structures. Responsive design strategies meant that the page was accessible and visually appealing across a variety of devices.
                JavaScript brought interactivity and functionality to the page. It provided functionality such as changing header colors on hover, toggling text visibility, smooth scrolling, and alert messages for registration actions.
